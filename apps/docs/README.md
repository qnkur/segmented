# `@qnkur/segmented` Showcase & Documentation

This Next.js application serves as the official showcase and documentation for the `@qnkur/segmented` component library.

It is part of a [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) monorepo. The main UI package is located in the `packages/ui` directory.

## Getting Started with Development

To run this documentation app locally, you'll need to start from the root of the monorepo.

1.  **Navigate to the root of the project:**

    ```bash
    cd ../..
    ```

2.  **Install all dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

    This will start the `docs` application on `http://localhost:3000`.
